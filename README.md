## Overview
In this project, I use K-Means clustering on NBA player statistics and compare the resulting clusters to classic NBA position groupings (Point Guard, Shooting Guard, Small Forward, Power Forward, Center). I sourced the player-season data and player-career data from the stats.nba.com API.

## Questions Answered
1. Is the NBA's evolution towards 3 position groups (point/wing/big) reflected in the clusters? Have the fit metrics for 3-cluster groupings improved over time? Have the 5-cluster groupings declined? 

No, instead we see that the fit for both numbers of clusters has steadily declined since the early 1980s.

## Potential Follow-Ups:
- How does changing the statistics used for clustering affect the results?
